        <div id="p1">Communism is a political and economic system that aims to create a classless society.
        In a communist society, all property and wealth are owned by the community, not by individuals.
        The government or community owns land, factories, and machinery, and everyone is expected to share
        the wealth they create.<br><br>

        Communism proposes a society where everyone shares the benefits of labor equally.
       It aims to close the gap between rich and poor, end the exploitation of workers,
       and free the poor from oppression.
       Communism is a type of government that combines the state leadership of a communist
        party, Marxist - Leninist political philosophy, and an official commitment to the
         construction of a communist society.
